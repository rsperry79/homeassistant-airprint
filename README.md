# AirPrint Server

This addon enables AirPrint functionality on your Home Assistant system, allowing Apple devices (iOS, macOS) to discover and print directly to printers connected to your network. It runs a CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) server with Avahi for Bonjour service discovery, providing a web interface for printer management and supporting SSL/TLS encryption.
